The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but there are some quirks and edge cases that can lead to unexpected behavior. For instance, using spaces inconsistently within `calc()` can cause it to fail.  Additionally, unit mismatches (e.g., adding pixels to percentages directly) can lead to errors.  Another less common issue is using nested `calc()` functions improperly, which can result in unexpected results or parsing errors.  Finally, certain older browsers may have limited support for more complex `calc()` expressions.
